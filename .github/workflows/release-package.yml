The above workflow if triggered by a push to the "release" branch. It checks out the GitHub repository, and uses the login-action to log in to the Container registry. It then extracts labels and tags for the Docker image. Finally, it uses the build-push-action action to build the image and publish it on the Container registry.

Publishing images to Docker Hub and GitHub Packages
In a single workflow, you can publish your Docker image to multiple registries by using the login-action and build-push-action actions for each registry.

The following example workflow uses the steps from the previous sections ("Publishing images to Docker Hub" and "Publishing images to GitHub Packages") to create a single workflow that pushes to both registries.
